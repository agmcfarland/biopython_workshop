# Biopython: Work with biological sequence data in Python
 
Welcome to the workshop! We will learn how to use Biopython for sequence manipulation, filtering, writing, and BLASTing!


## Running workshop code

There are two options to run the workshop code:

1. Open the main github directory in [google colab]() and select the notebook (.ipynb) you wish to run. 

* Each notebook will have all the data necessary

2. Clone the repository and open the notebook you wish to run. 


## Files

In the main directory you will find three different categories of files

### Lesson Notebooks

There are five jupyter notebooks, one for each day


### Answer Notebooks

There are five jupyter notebooks, one for each day, with the answers to all the exercises in the lessons

### Data

Different data files of extension .fasta, .gbk, and .xml
